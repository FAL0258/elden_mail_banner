## ⚠️ Known Issues
You may need to refresh the page when you leave it open for a long time before it works.

## 🌍 Language Support
Currently, Elden Mail Banner works only in Italian, because it detects the send button by looking for the Italian text "Invia" in Gmail and Outlook Web.

If you want to make it work in another language:

- Open the file: `content.js`
- Find all occurrences of `Invia` (for example: `[aria-label^="Invia"], [data-tooltip^="Invia"] button[title="Invia"]`)
- Replace `Invia` with the equivalent Send button text in your language: `Send` → English, `Enviar` → Spanish, `Envoyer` → French, `Senden` → German. Or whatever your email browser displays.

💡 Tip: You can add multiple languages by separating selectors with commas, e.g.: `[aria-label^="Invia"], [aria-label^="Send"], [aria-label^="Envoyer"]`

A multi-language version is planned for a future release.
